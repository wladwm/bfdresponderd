README for bfdresponderd
*******************

bfdresponderd is an open source package that provides a software based 
implementation of the Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) protocol. 
At this time - only passive asyncronious.
It will simply establish BFD session to any incoming request, setting discriminator to incoming+1.
This software allows host failure detection for routers using standard hardware/software trackers for anycast static routes. So you can make georeserved services based on L3, without L2 VRRP/CARP, which have well-known flaws.
